Introduction
================

It was mentioned that students can quickly master the D programming language without a detailed study using mostly its subset, which is close to the C PL. 

Consider a simple program that reads from a file of 10 lines, each containing a single number and prints to the standard output at the same number, but shifted to the mathematician expectation.

Whereas idiomatic D code looks pretty unusual:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/readdoubles2.d
    :language: d
    :tab-width: 4

for many unfamiliar with the language D the same program can be implemented even as more complex, but at the same time more understandable way:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/readdoubles1.d
    :language: d
    :tab-width: 4

The present documentation is submitted to the rapid introduction to D for those who are already somehow familiar with the C language and for some reasons do not want to waste time on a consistent study of the D language and related tools.

If you decide to use the D language in your daily work, you should start immediately with the study of the  `official page <http://dlang.org>`_ and of the book `"The D Programming Language" <http://erdani.com/index.php/books/tdpl/>`_ by Andrei Alexandrescu.

Probably D is the most powerful of the present `system programming languages <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_programming_language>`_.
